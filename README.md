# What will we do in this project?

In this project we will take a look at the survival rate of patients with advanced lung cancer using **the Cox proportional-hazards model**.

The Cox proportional-hazards model (Cox, 1972) is essentially a regression model commonly used statistical in medical research for investigating the association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.


It is very common for different types of businesses for example to study business applications related to subscription models or problems where time is a determining factor for an event to happen.

The advantage of using The Cox proportional-hazards model over other Survival Analysis models is that with this model is possible to use multiple predictors which can be both continuous and binary.
